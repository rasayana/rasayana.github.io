Once up on a time, in a big country ( like our current Indian democracy ), people selected their leader by popular demand  and selected him to lead the big country for next 5 years as King ( like our Prime Minister ). 


 In one of it's province ( like current UP / Maharashtra / Bihar / Karnataka ) people ( like all of us living here in Bangalore / Pune / Noida paying tax to run government ) from some distrcits were agitating against the family members of Governor ( like our chief ministers ) who were part of conspiracy  of diverting river water flowing course to suite their personal interests in his province leading to loss of revenue to province's treasury and outrage caused in support of agitating people accross nation leading to loss of face to him in front of King and nation.

Governor got angry and he punished the agitating people by using all his pollitical clout to bend rules in judiciary to get verdict in his favour. The verdict / punishment was to eat 50 onions or 50 whips to all guilty. Few folks opted for eating 50 onions, others opted for 50 whips. After eating 5 onions with lot of difficulty, they opted for 50 whips and people who opted for 50 whips, after getting beaten for 5 times opted for eating 50 onions. and no body could complete punishment because they were switching between 2 options alternatively till they got perished. they did not had any other 3rd option. 

In India, since independence we had many corrupt / pseudo secular corrupt / fanatic corrupt / small time corrupt / big time corrupt to rule us alternatively or for long time. we need to vote out all these people. Corruption is our enemy # 1. Eradicate it.
